This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app) and then modified to include an Express server and PostgreSQL database.

## Getting Started

-- npm init -y
-- npm i
-- npm run dev (runs express and nextjs concurrently)
-- code away!
